## DESCRIPTION
When used together, Vault Professional software and Fusion Lifecycle software provide a combined solution that is the best of all worlds for product data management (PDM) and product lifecycle management (PLM). While Vault runs on-premises to keep your CAD data safe behind your firewall, Fusion Lifecycle is cloud based for flexibility and ease of deployment. Sadly, this has made a seamless integration between the two difficult—until now. This class describes the benefits of the Vault Fusion Lifecycle Connector (vaultFLC), including installation, configuration, and extensibility, so you can create a best-of-all-worlds solution.
